Welcome to our website in progress. We love customer suggestions, so if there is any content you'd like to see here, let us know!

Up in Arms Brewery has the goal of providing a fresh, constantly-changing selection of beers to quench the demand of the local Vermont 
beer-drinking community. We love what we do, and hope that it comes across as you are enjoying one of our unique brews. Our mission is 
to source locally, obtaining hops from our brewery's hop yards, malt from local farmers, and the clearest of natural spring water 
that we find rushing from the peaks of our beautiful VT mountains.

<p>

 More to come,
 
</p>
